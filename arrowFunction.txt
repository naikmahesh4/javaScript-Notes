Arrow Function:-

Arrow functions – also called “fat arrow” functions, from CoffeeScript (a transcompiled language) — are a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. They utilize a new token, =>, that looks like a fat arrow. Arrow functions are anonymous and change the way this binds in functions.

app.js:-
---
const sayHello = function(){
	console.log('say Hello');
	}
sayHello();

const sayHello = () => { --)first here we don't need a function keyword,so parenthesis is empty and curly braces in between both we need to put a arrow which is an equal sign and a greater than sign.
 	console.log('hello')
	}
sayHello(); 

ouput: Hello
